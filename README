dt-init-scripts

It's initramfs script with hooks inspired by Archlinux.
It's also a set of scripts for opposite task: shutdown with proper deinitialization of subsystems.

Currently implemented hooks providing support for:
	- plymouth
	- rngd
	- luks
	- luks_decrypted
	- suspend
	- raid
	- dm-integrity
	- kernel modules

rngd module is disabled by default and may be used as source of entropy
if luks module or some other entropy-using module is used.

luks_decrypted module, unlike luks module, keeps luks key decrypted,
and thus is not recommended for unsafe environments.
